      question: 'How long does the blood donation process take?',
      answer: 'The entire blood donation process typically takes 45-60 minutes. The actual blood collection takes only 8-10 minutes, while the rest of the time is spent on registration, health screening, and post-donation refreshments.'
    },
    {
      category: 'eligibility',
      question: 'What are the basic requirements to donate blood?',

    },
    {
      category: 'health',
      question: 'Is blood donation safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, blood donation is completely safe. We use sterile, single-use equipment for each donor. All needles and blood bags are disposed of after one use. Our medical staff follows strict safety protocols to ensure your well-being.'

      category: 'donation',
      question: 'What should I do before donating blood?',

    {
      category: 'health',
      question: 'What happens to my blood after donation?',

    },
    {
      category: 'health',
      question: 'Are there any side effects after donating blood?',
      answer: 'Most people feel fine after donating. Some may experience mild dizziness or fatigue, which is normal. We provide refreshments and monitor all donors. Serious side effects are extremely rare.'
    },
    {
      category: 'eligibility',
      question: 'Can I donate if I am taking medication?',
      answer: 'It depends on the medication. Many common medications do not disqualify you from donating. However, some medications may require a waiting period. Please consult with our medical staff about your specific medications.'
    },
    {
      category: 'general',
      question: 'What blood types are most needed?',
